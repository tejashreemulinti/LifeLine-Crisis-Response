## 🧠 Problem

Emergency responders receive thousands of messages on social media every minute
during disasters. Manual triage is slow, error-prone, and dangerous.

---

## 💡 Solution

LifeLine is a **multi-agent emergency classification + geolocation + reporting**
pipeline using Google ADK.

It processes unstructured text (messages, posts, alerts) and converts them into:

- incident type
- confidence
- verified classification
- exact latitude/longitude
- generated emergency summary
- recommended action
- stored structured report

## 🧩 ADK Features Used

✔ Multi-Agent System  
✔ Tools (custom + API)  
✔ Memory Bank (long-term JSON store)  
✔ Sessions & Context  
✔ A2A Communication  
✔ Logging & Metrics  
✔ Observability  
✔ Production-ready design
